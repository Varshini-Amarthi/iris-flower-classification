# iris-flower-classification
This project was created using machine learning which makes us to get clear accuracy score of the iris flower at the end of the project.
Iris flowers have an unusual structure and appearance. The petals resemble a classic fleur-de-lis symbol, with some petals rising up while others cascade down. The center petals stand upright and are known botanically as standards. These tall petals stand like signal flags, waving in potential pollinators.
I used machine learning models to ocmplete this project.
I collected the datasets from "Kaggle.com".
And finally the accuracy_score i got after completing the whole process on iris flower classificaion was perfect.
